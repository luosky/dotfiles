# dotfiles

These are dotfiles I created or ripped from others.

## Usage
use `rake backup` to backup existing dotfiles to `~/.dotfiles-backup` directory  
use `rake link` to link dotfiles to `~/`  
use `rake install` to backup and link dotfiles to `~/`

## notes

`other_configs` directory won't be install to home directory. It is used to store configs not in the home directory. You need to link it manually.
